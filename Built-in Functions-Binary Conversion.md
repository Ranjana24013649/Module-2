# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
a=16

b=bin(a)

print(b)

## Output

![440387383-f4d3c1a4-4679-492d-a486-aa715c8ceacd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8cbe7f4-01cc-4a32-8509-a9b6cba4a549)



## Result

Thus the program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator is executed successfully.
